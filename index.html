        Another group of terrorists opened fire on occupants of Leopold Cafe,
        Colaba (at a distance of 2.5 km from CST). They took some hostages
        including a Jewish couple.[8] Later, the group holed itself up inside
        Nariman House after taking hostages while another group forced
        themselves inside the lobby of Hotel Taj (at 0.5 km from Nariman House).
        They threw grenades and fired on the people inside the hotel lobby.
        Later, they moved onto the third floor and took some hostages including
        foreigners. They tried to blast the dome of the hotel and set the hotel
        on fire through grenade blast. Yet another group of terrorists entered
        into the lobby of Hotel Trident Oberai (at 1.5 km from CST) and started
        indiscriminate firing at different locations such as pool side/upper
        floors and took hostages. Two taxies carrying explosives exploded and
        killed its drivers and inmates in WadiBunder and Vile Parle area.[9] In

        terrorist attacks in Mumbai were launched from Karachi from where a
        group of 10 Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) fidayeens (all Pakistanis) equipped
        with arms/ammunition had sailed off on November 23,2008.[11][12] A new
        militant outfit called Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the
        attack.[13] Investigations have revealed that the sender of the email
        was connected to Zarrar Shah Communication,[14] Coordinator of LeT based
        in Pakistan. One of the perpetrators namely Ajmal belonging to district
        Okara of Pakistan, who was captured, revealed in his interrogation his
        LeT connections and other details about the attack. According to him,
        the operation was planned by Zaki-ur-Rehman of LeT. Nine terrorists
        killed in the operations by the security forces in Mumbai have been
        identified by Ajmal as his fidayeen associates from LeT.[15]
